- Never enable `skipLibCheck`, `esmoduleInterop`, `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` or other compiler options that would force consumers of this library to _also_ enable them
- Keeping the library consumable as CommonJS modules is important! We cannot presume that our users are ready to consume ES modules directly
- For new libraries, make the compiler options as strict as possible (except for fallthrough cases in switch statements -- those are fine)
