- never use `//@ts-ignore` or `//@ts-expect-error` without getting permission from the user first
- only use the non-null assertion operator in tests, never in source code
- strongly prefer the use of type guards over casting
- when declaring constants of object types, use the `satisfies` keyword instead of a type annotation
- only use `any` where literally any TypeScript value is permissable (e.g. `console.log`)
