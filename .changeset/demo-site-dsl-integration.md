feat: integrate Progressive DSL System with bidirectional rule editor interface

Adds comprehensive DSL integration to the demo site, showcasing the Progressive DSL System's three-layer rule authoring approach with seamless bidirectional transformations.

**New Components**:

- **IntentRuleEditor**: Natural language rule authoring interface using Level 1 (Intent-based) expressions
- Enhanced **CustomPolicyModal**: Unified interface supporting both intent-based and dimensional rule editors with mode switching

**Key Features**:

- **Bidirectional Mode Switching**: Users can seamlessly switch between intent mode (natural language) and dimensional mode (multi-dimensional classification)
- **Live Preview**: Real-time transformation preview showing how rules appear across different DSL representation levels
- **Interactive Examples**: Demonstration of common rule patterns in both natural language and dimensional formats
- **Validation Feedback**: Built-in validation with helpful error messages and suggestions

**User Experience Improvements**:

- Intuitive toggle between "Write rules naturally" (intent mode) and "Advanced configuration" (dimensional mode)
- Contextual help and examples for both authoring approaches
- Seamless rule migration when switching between modes
- Enhanced discoverability of the Progressive DSL System capabilities

This integration demonstrates the full power of the Progressive DSL System, enabling users to author API change detection rules at their preferred level of complexity while maintaining full interoperability between all representation levels.
