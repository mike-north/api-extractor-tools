## PatternTemplate type

Pattern templates with placeholders for structured rule definitions.

The Pattern DSL provides template-based rules with `{placeholder}` syntax for variable substitution, offering more flexibility than intent expressions while remaining readable.

\#\# Template Categories

\*\*Action Templates:\*\* - `'added {target}'` - Something was added - `'removed {target}'` - Something was removed - `'renamed {target}'` - Something was renamed - `'reordered {target}'` - Something was reordered - `'modified {target}'` - Something was modified

\*\*Action + Modifier Templates:\*\* - `'added required {target}'` - Required addition - `'added optional {target}'` - Optional addition - `'removed optional {target}'` - Optional removal

\*\*Aspect Templates:\*\* - `'{target} type narrowed'` - Type became more restrictive - `'{target} type widened'` - Type became less restrictive - `'{target} made optional'` - Became optional - `'{target} made required'` - Became required - `'{target} deprecated'` - Marked as deprecated - `'{target} undeprecated'` - Removed deprecation

\*\*Conditional Templates:\*\* - `'{pattern} when {condition}'` - Pattern with condition - `'{pattern} unless {condition}'` - Pattern with negated condition - `'{pattern} for {nodeKind}'` - Pattern for specific node types

\*\*Compound Templates:\*\* - `'{pattern} and {pattern}'` - Multiple patterns (AND) - `'{pattern} or {pattern}'` - Alternative patterns (OR)

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type PatternTemplate = 'added {target}' | 'removed {target}' | 'renamed {target}' | 'reordered {target}' | 'modified {target}' | 'added required {target}' | 'added optional {target}' | 'removed optional {target}' | '{target} type narrowed' | '{target} type widened' | '{target} made optional' | '{target} made required' | '{target} deprecated' | '{target} undeprecated' | '{pattern} when {condition}' | '{pattern} unless {condition}' | '{pattern} for {nodeKind}' | '{pattern} and {pattern}' | '{pattern} or {pattern}';
```

## Example


```typescript
const patternPolicy = createProgressivePolicy()
  .pattern('removed {target}', { target: 'export' }, 'major')
  .pattern('added optional {target}', { target: 'parameter' }, 'none')
  .pattern('{target} type narrowed', { target: 'return-type' }, 'major')
  .pattern('removed {target} when {condition}', {
    target: 'property',
    condition: 'not inherited'
  }, 'major')
  .build('pattern-based-policy', 'none')
```
