Policy for write-only/producer APIs (contravariant position).

Optimized for producers who WRITE to the API: - Type narrowing is safe (stricter requirements, existing code still valid) - Type widening is breaking (must handle new value types) - Removing optional members is safe (don't need to provide) - Adding required members is breaking (must provide new values)

**Signature:**
