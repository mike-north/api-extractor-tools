Policy for read-only/consumer APIs (covariant position).

Optimized for consumers who READ from the API: - Type widening is safe (more values to receive) - Type narrowing is breaking (might not handle all values) - Adding members is safe (more data available) - Removing members is breaking (expected data missing)

**Signature:**
