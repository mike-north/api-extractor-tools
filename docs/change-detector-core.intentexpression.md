## IntentExpression type

> This API is provided as an alpha preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

Natural language expressions that capture user intent directly. These are the simplest, most readable forms of rules.

The Intent DSL allows you to express change rules using natural language expressions that capture your intent directly.

\#\# Supported Expression Categories

\*\*Removal Patterns:\*\* - `'breaking removal'` - Any removal that breaks the API - `'safe removal'` - Removals that don't break compatibility - `'export removal is breaking'` - Specifically export removals - `'member removal is breaking'` - Specifically member removals

\*\*Addition Patterns:\*\* - `'safe addition'` - Additions that don't break compatibility - `'required addition is breaking'` - Required additions that break compatibility - `'optional addition is safe'` - Optional additions that are safe

\*\*Type Change Patterns:\*\* - `'type narrowing is breaking'` - Type changes that narrow possibilities - `'type widening is safe'` - Type changes that widen possibilities - `'type change is breaking'` - Any type change is breaking

\*\*Optionality Patterns:\*\* - `'making optional is breaking'` - Making required things optional - `'making required is breaking'` - Making optional things required

\*\*Common Patterns:\*\* - `'deprecation is patch'` - Deprecations result in patch releases - `'rename is breaking'` - Renames are breaking changes - `'reorder is breaking'` - Reordering parameters is breaking

\*\*Conditional Patterns:\*\* - `'breaking removal when nested'` - Conditional expressions using "when" - `'safe addition unless required'` - Conditional expressions using "unless"

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type IntentExpression = 'breaking removal' | 'safe removal' | 'export removal is breaking' | 'member removal is breaking' | 'safe addition' | 'required addition is breaking' | 'optional addition is safe' | 'type narrowing is breaking' | 'type widening is safe' | 'type change is breaking' | 'making optional is breaking' | 'making required is breaking' | 'deprecation is patch' | 'rename is breaking' | 'reorder is breaking' | `${string} when ${string}` | `${string} unless ${string}`;
```

## Example


```typescript
const intentPolicy = createProgressivePolicy()
  .intent('export removal is breaking', 'major')
  .intent('rename is breaking', 'major')
  .intent('optional addition is safe', 'none')
  .intent('deprecation is patch', 'patch')
  .intent('breaking removal when nested', 'major')
  .build('intent-based-policy', 'none')
```
