### Patch Changes

- [#51](https://github.com/mike-north/api-extractor-tools/pull/51) [`3f6a6a5`](https://github.com/mike-north/api-extractor-tools/commit/3f6a6a50264c88ff540db438065a6a5b9dc59701) Thanks [@mike-north](https://github.com/mike-north)! - Convert theme toggle button to dropdown for better UX

  The theme selector is now a dropdown instead of a 3-state cycle button, making it immediately clear that there are three theme options available (Light, Dark, and Auto). This improves discoverability and makes the current selection more obvious to users.
